# PennDriveApp
PennApps 2023 Project

USAGE
The folder that contains the exe for PennDrive should also contain:

A folder for resources called 'resources' (CANNOT BE > 25MB)
A video file of a meeting or lecture recording called 'videofile.mp4' (Cannot handle very large files; working on optimization)
A csv spreadsheet of participants (see below for example format) called 'people.csv'
Once all the above are in the folder, double click the app PennDrive.exe. After about 5-7 seconds, you can remove the usb completely and wait for an email within a few minutes.

Example csv file:

name,email
john,johndoe@example.com
jane,jane.smith@other.com
...,...
